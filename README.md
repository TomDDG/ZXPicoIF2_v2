# ZXPicoIF2_v2

Sinclair Interface 2 replacement including ROM Cartridge emulation using a Raspberry Pico. This is a new version of the original ZXPicoIF2 (https://github.com/TomDDG/ZXPicoIF2Lite) with the main change being it uses a micro SD Card instead of flash memory. As with the original the main purpose of this interface is to replicate the Sinclair Interface 2 allowing the user to load ROMs and Z80/SNA snapshots.
